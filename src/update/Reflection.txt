Reflection:

For the update package, I used 3 ways to do DML operations. The differences of 3 methods varies on how to insert and execute an sql statement and how to add parameters into the sql statement. For my code design, I hae created exception class to end the program if error occurs. By catch block, the code will catch the exception and print out statment to show error. I have added the check part for each classes wtih statement  "SELECT * FROM country WHERE country_id = " to check the row data after any DML operations. Using resultSet is a more different way to do dml operations since a table of data is created beforehand. Cursor have to moved for operation, for example using beforeFirst();. Data is modified by the dataframe created, for example using method updateString() and updateFloat().
